A lightweight, minimal, fast and geeky retro theme remembering the good old terminal times.

== Description ==
The idea to create this theme was born while watching the movie "Wargames" with its old computers and funny terminals.
It is of course of interest for nerds and geeks to blog about their daily business or remembering good old time back in the 80s
when we use those green shining terminals.

The theme is lightweight and somehow minimal without any special and shiny features but with some small geeky highlights like ASCII-Art 
header, logo and a terminal news ticker for the headlines and as a widget. It is responsive has up to three widgets in the footer but only one-column. 
You can configure the theme using the customiser to change colors and tun on or off header features. 

Please have the follwing things in mind when using the theme:
	* Onecolumn, there are no sidebars left and right but there are three widgetareas in the footer
	* The ASCII-Art header will switch to text when the device-width gets smaller 
	* All theme specific settings are in the customizer
	* Using a custom header image will replace the blog-title
	* If comments are closed no comments, pings or trackbacks are displayed and no hint about closed comments is displayed intentionally
	

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change this nice little ASCII-Art logo? =

You can change it using the WordPress customizer. Select one of the three logos which come with the theme, disable it or enter your own ASCII-Art.

= I can't see the fancy ASCII-Art header. What's wrong? =

Probably you are using a smaller device which makes the theme switch to mobile, text representation. Try it on a bigger device.

= Can I use the ticker in the footer too? =

Yes, you can. RetroGeek comes with a Ticker-Widget. Just drag-and-drop it to the footer widgetareas like any other widget.
